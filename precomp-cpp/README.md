What is Precomp?
----------------
Precomp is a command line precompressor that can be used to further compress files that are already compressed. It improves compression on some file-/streamtypes - works on files and streams that are compressed with zLib or the Deflate compression method (like PDF, PNG, ZIP and many more), bZip2, GIF, JPG and MP3. Precomp tries to decompress the streams, and if they can be decompressed and "re-"compressed so that they are bit-to-bit-identical with the original stream, the decompressed stream can be used instead of the compressed one.

The result of Precomp is either a smaller, LZMA2 compressed file with extension .pcf (PCF = PreCompressedFile) or, when using `-cn`, a file containing decompressed data from the original file together with reconstruction data. In this case, the file is larger than the original file, but can be compressed with any compression algorithm stronger than Deflate to get better compression.

Since version 0.4.3, Precomp is available for Linux/*nix/macOS, too. The different versions are completely compatible, PCF files are exchangeable between Windows/Linux/*nix/macOS systems.

Usage example
-------------
|Command|Comment|
|--|--|
|`wget http://mattmahoney.net/dc/silesia.zip` <br> (or download from [here](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/silesia.html))|We want to compress this file (the [Silesia compression corpus](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia)). <br>Size: 67,633,896 bytes (100,0%)|
|`7z a -mx=9 silesia.7z silesia.zip`|Compressing with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) LZMA2, setting "Ultra". <br>Size: 67,405,052 bytes (99,7%)|
|`precomp silesia.zip`|Compressing with Precomp results in `silesia.pcf`. <br>Size: 47,122,779 bytes (69,7%)|
|`precomp -r -osilesia.zip_ silesia.pcf`|This restores the original file to a new file named `silesia.zip_`. <br> Without the `-o` parameter, Precomp would decompress to `silesia.zip`.|
|`diff -s silesia.zip silesia.zip_`|Compares the original file to the result file, they're identical|
