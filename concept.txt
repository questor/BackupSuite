	# -m5 is dead slow :/
	# -m4 is much faster already and still better than lzma2 from precomp-cpp

Workflow:

Start by creating a database and compressed file of a specific input folder by "creating"
an archive and it's database with the following parameters:
	-c -i path_to_input -o path_to_output -d path_to_db -t path_to_compiled_tools
Here inputs is your source of files to backup (for example the folder with all pictures), 
path to output is were the compressed output and the filelist of this backup-run is
created and which can be stored to backup-media (dvd, tape, ...). This output-folder can
be deleted after it is stored to another media. The db should not be
created in the output folder, but instead in a folder stored on the harddisc as reference
for future runs. In this database the cummulative file status is stored.

Now changes can be done to the input folder to reflect working on the files (changing files
and adding new ones).

To create the next archive update set rerun the ctrlcenter with the arguments from above, but
use a different output-folder (or use the same as above but with cleared content). The program
will check, based on the knowledge of the database, if files were changed or added. These files
will be compressed (and recompressed) and only these changed files will be stored in the new
folder.

Deleted files will stay in the database file so if you read them to the original path nothing
additional will be updated. If you add the original files to a different path the files will
be recompressed and stored at the different path! (No deduplication).

In case that the database is corrupt, gone or something else happened you can recreate it by
merging the hashfiles to the database, start by removing the current database file and merge
the hashfiles from all backups into the database to get a up-to-date database again.
